## Algorithms

### Selection Sort

This algorithm takes an unsorted list as input and produces a sorted list as output. This is done by iterating through the input list, then for each element, finding the smallest element after it in the list. The algorithm then swaps these two values.


### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort, poor performance sort traditionally used only on small scale sorting projects. Sorts by iterating through a list swapping values that are in the wrong order.


### Insertion Sort

This algorithm takes an unsorted list as input and produces a sorted list as output. The algorithm iterates through each element and swaps it with the previous element until it is correctly placed in the sorted list.


## Installation

This project requires Python3. To install all other dependancies, run ```pip3 install requirements.txt```
Methods in this module can be called using ```$METHOD_sort.py``` and take a list of integers as input.


## Testing

To test this module, simply run ```python3 -m pytest .``` or, if the virtual environment is activated, ```pytest```
