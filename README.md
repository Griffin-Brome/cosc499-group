## Algorithms

### Selection Sort

This algorithm takes an unsorted list as input and produces a sorted list as output. This is done by iterating through the input list, then for each element, finding the smallest element after it in the list. The algorithm then swaps these two values.

## Installation

This project requires Python3. To install all other dependancies, run ```pip3 install requirements.txt```
